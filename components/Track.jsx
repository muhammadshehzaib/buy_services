              According to the data from Views4You's "Best Time to Post on Youtube" tool, a study evaluating 980 customers who posted at the most optimal times found that those who quickly bought YouTube views following their videos performed better than those who did not. This improvement in performance is attributed to the rapid influx of views post-sharing, which is believed to trigger YouTube's algorithm, resulting in the content being recommended more frequently.

          <p>
            Views4You data of 2023 showed that the best time to post on YouTube is between 5 PM and 7 PM local time on weekdays. But there is more! Keep reading to find out. According to data collected from 5.300 YouTube channels, the results were found to be true across all major countries in the world, including America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific countries. These hours were chosen because they offer a significantly higher rate of engagement than other times throughout the day or night. During this window of time, viewership peak hours, and subscribers tend to be more active than during any other part of the day. Although the data suggests that during weekdays between 5 PM and 7 PM local time is the ideal period for uploading content all over the world, the one specific best time to post is Wednesdays at 7 PM as this is when most of the YouTube channel subscribers will be online and ready to watch your content as 76 % of YouTubers data has shown.
          </p> <br />
          <p className="my-5">
            <span className='font-bold text-[18px]'>Data Based on Age Groups</span> <br />It was based on the data collection of their own YouTube engagement analysis that the 18-25 age group called young adults prefers to watch videos between 12 AM – 2 PM and 6 PM 9 PM since it’s time they do lunch break or go home to watch YouTube video uploads while eating dinner as 92 % of the YouTube users claimed to choose to “watch videos while eating.” We believe it’s the thing of the new generation who grew up watching anything to finish up their food. On the other hand, the 25-40 age group prefers to watch YouTube videos between 7 PM and 10 PM since they finally have some relaxing time to watch video content. During these times, viewers are more likely to watch for more extended periods of time and will be more likely to engage with your relevant content by leaving comments or sharing your video. Additionally, analytics showed that Fridays might be an ideal time for posting if you’re hoping to reach “the most people in the shortest amount of time.” In other words, if you’re trying to get your video to go viral, it might be a good idea to post it on Friday.
          </p> <br />
          <p className="my-5">
            <span className='font-bold text-[18px]'>Data Based on Gender </span> <br /> When it comes to gender groups, 86% of the female YouTubers’ statistics resulted that when they upload YouTube videos on Friday at 8 PM by scheduling it days before, they got better engagement ratings than their non-scheduled YouTube videos. This indicates that female YouTubers’ audience loves consistent posting of their favorite content creators. It also means that when scheduling your posting time on YouTube, it is actually a powerful factor to be watched by more viewers, especially when your audience has been waiting for you to post videos. 69 % of the male YouTubers’ statistics have shown that no matter when they post, their audience finds their videos and usually watches them over and over again. It may be because of the funniness they put their videos to make them more appealing to a male-generated target audience.
          </p> <br />
          <p className="my-5">
            <span className='font-bold text-[18px]'>Data Based on Months</span> <br /> Again, the results show that the end of each month (around 3-4 days before the new month begins) can be considered as a great time since people tend to use that time period in order to catch up on their favorite channels and find new ones. It’s also stated that there is a holiday spirit run over YouTube. Holidays always bring an influx of viewers who might be looking for something different from traditional holiday content, thus making this an excellent opportunity for your channel to shine. The year-end holidays are a prime time for viewers to spend some quality time with their family, friends, and favorite YouTubers. As such, an increase in engagement rates happens right around this time – usually between November and December. This means posting content as early as October gives you plenty of time to boost your views and more traffic before Christmas. This is especially true if you have any holiday-themed or celebratory videos planned. What should be extra said about the timing of YouTube content is that people tend to look for winter activities during this season since, in summer, they tend to live their lives offline. Hence, you must plan ahead and ensure your videos are ready to be watched for the winter seasons. The insights gained from this survey can be used to inform content creation and posting schedules for YouTube creators, ensuring that the largest possible audience sees their videos. Additionally, understanding when peak viewing times occur can help inform ad placement decisions and ensure maximum visibility for video campaigns. With this data in hand, creators now have more tools to ensure their content reaches a wider audience.
